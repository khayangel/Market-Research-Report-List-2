<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Retinal Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>No Mydriasis</li><li>Mydriasis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Portable retinal scanners are devices used for non-invasive imaging of the retina for diagnosis of various eye conditions. They can be classified into two main market types based on the use of mydriasis. No Mydriasis scanners do not require the dilation of the pupil for imaging, making them more convenient for the patient. On the other hand, Mydriasis scanners use dilation to achieve better image quality, but can be uncomfortable for the patient. Both types offer valuable diagnostic information for eye care professionals.</p></p>
