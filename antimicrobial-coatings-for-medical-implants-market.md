<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antimicrobial Coatings for Medical Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metallic</li><li>Non-Metallic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Antimicrobial coatings for medical implants are divided into two main types: metallic and non-metallic. Metallic coatings, such as silver and copper, release antimicrobial ions to inhibit bacterial growth on the implant surface. Non-metallic coatings, like polymers and ceramics, work by physically disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria. Both types of coatings are used to reduce the risk of infection following implant surgery and improve the overall success of medical implant procedures.</p></p>
