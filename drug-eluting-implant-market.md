<p><h1>Drug Eluting Implant Market: Challenges, Opportunities, and Growth Drivers and Major Market Players forecasted for period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Drug Eluting Implant Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A drug eluting implant is a medical device that is coated with a drug in order to deliver a controlled dose directly to the target site within the body. These implants are commonly used in various medical procedures, such as orthopedic surgeries, cardiovascular interventions, and ophthalmology treatments.</p><p>The Drug Eluting Implant Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.2% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and osteoarthritis, which require the use of drug eluting implants for treatment. Additionally, advancements in technology and an increasing number of minimally invasive surgeries are further driving the market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Drug Eluting Implant Market is the development of bioresorbable drug eluting implants, which are designed to gradually dissolve within the body after delivering the drug. This helps eliminate the need for a second surgery to remove the implant, reducing the risk of complications and improving patient outcomes. Additionally, the growing focus on personalized medicine and the use of biodegradable materials in implant manufacturing are also shaping the market trends.</p></p>
