<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Air Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous</li><li>Non-Porous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membrane air dryers come in two main types: porous and non-porous. Porous membrane air dryers utilize a membrane material with small pores that allow water vapor to pass through while blocking liquid water and oil. This type is efficient for removing moisture from compressed air. On the other hand, non-porous membrane air dryers use a different material that absorbs moisture from the air, making them suitable for applications where precise control over humidity levels is required. Both types offer effective solutions for drying compressed air in various industries.</p></p>
