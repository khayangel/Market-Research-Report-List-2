<p><h1>Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery Market Size, Market Trends, and Growth Outlook forecasted for period from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) is a method used to increase the production of oil by injecting heat into the reservoir to make the oil more fluid and easier to extract. This technique is employed when traditional methods of oil recovery have been exhausted. Thermal EOR is particularly effective in heavy oil reservoirs where the oil is too viscous to flow through traditional means.</p><p>The Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery Market is experiencing significant growth with a projected CAGR of 13.8% during the forecast period. The increasing global demand for oil and the need to maximize production from existing oil fields are driving the growth of the market. Other factors contributing to the growth of the Thermal EOR market include advancements in technology, government support for EOR projects, and the rising investments in oil production.</p><p>The latest trends in the Thermal Enhanced Oil Recovery Market include the development of new thermal EOR techniques such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and in-situ combustion. Additionally, companies are focusing on improving the efficiency and sustainability of thermal EOR processes by using renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, the Thermal EOR market is expected to continue its growth trajectory in the coming years.</p></p>
