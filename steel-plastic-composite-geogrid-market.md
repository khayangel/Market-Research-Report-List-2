<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel-Plastic Composite Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial Tension</li><li>Uniaxial Tension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steel-Plastic Composite Geogrids are widely used in civil engineering for soil reinforcement. There are two main market types for these geogrids: Biaxial Tension and Uniaxial Tension. Biaxial Tension geogrids have strong tensile strength in both directions, making them suitable for applications requiring multidirectional reinforcement, such as road construction. Uniaxial Tension geogrids have primary strength in one direction, making them ideal for applications where reinforcement is needed primarily in one direction, such as retaining walls or steep slopes.</p></p>
