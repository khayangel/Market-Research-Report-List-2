<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airboat Propellers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Drive</li><li>Reduction Gear</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Airboat propellers are divided into two main types: Direct drive and Reduction Gear. Direct drive propellers are directly connected to the engine, providing a simple and efficient propulsion system. These propellers are ideal for smaller, lightweight airboats. On the other hand, Reduction Gear propellers use a gear system to decrease the speed of the engine and increase torque, allowing for more power and control in larger airboats. Reduction gear propellers are commonly used in commercial and heavy-duty airboat applications.</p></p>
