<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Contact Ultrasonic Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Type</li><li>Sealed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Contact ultrasonic sensors are available in two main types: open type and sealed type. Open type sensors are designed with a large sensing surface that allows for accurate detection of any objects within a certain range. These sensors are typically used in environments where dust or moisture may accumulate. Sealed type sensors, on the other hand, are enclosed in a protective casing that makes them more robust and resistant to external environmental factors. Sealed type sensors are commonly used in harsh industrial environments where ruggedness is essential.</p></p>
