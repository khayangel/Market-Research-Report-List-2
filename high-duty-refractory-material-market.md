<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-Duty Refractory Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shaped High-duty Refractory</li><li>Unshaped High-duty Refractory</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High-duty refractory materials are classified into two main types: shaped high-duty refractory and unshaped high-duty refractory. Shaped high-duty refractory materials are pre-formed into specific shapes such as bricks, blocks, and tubes, making them easy to install and replace. Unshaped high-duty refractory materials, on the other hand, are monolithic materials like castables, plastics, and ramming mixes that are applied in a plastic or paste-like state and then hardened in place. Both types offer excellent resistance to high temperatures and chemical corrosion.</p></p>
