<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soluble Coffee Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray Drying</li><li>Freeze Drying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soluble coffee can be marketed in two main types: spray drying and freeze drying. In spray drying, the coffee extract is sprayed into a hot chamber, where the water evaporates, leaving behind dry coffee particles. This method is more cost-effective and produces a larger volume of coffee. On the other hand, freeze drying involves freezing the coffee extract and then removing the ice through sublimation, resulting in coffee with better aroma and flavor retention. This method is more expensive but produces higher quality soluble coffee.</p></p>
