<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Inkjet Printer Head Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Type</li><li>Thermal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial inkjet printer heads are commonly classified into two types: piezoelectric and thermal. Piezoelectric printheads use electric currents to produce small droplets of ink, resulting in precise and high-quality prints. On the other hand, thermal printheads heat the ink to create a bubble, which then expels the ink onto the printing surface. Both types have their own advantages and limitations, making them suitable for different applications in the industrial inkjet printer market.</p></p>
