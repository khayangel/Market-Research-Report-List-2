<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small and Medium Wind Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical-Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small and Medium Wind Turbines refer to wind turbines designed for residential, commercial, or community use. The two main types of wind turbines are Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) and Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). HAWTs have blades that rotate around a horizontal axis, while VAWTs have blades that rotate around a vertical axis. HAWTs are more commonly used and have higher efficiency, while VAWTs are more suitable for urban or rooftop installations due to their compact size and noiseless operation.</p></p>
