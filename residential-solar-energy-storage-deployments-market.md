<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Solar Energy Storage Deployments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Li-Ion</li><li>Lead-Acid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Residential solar energy storage deployments typically use two main types of battery technologies: lithium-ion (Li-Ion) and lead-acid. Li-Ion batteries are known for their high energy density, longer lifespan, and faster charging capabilities, making them ideal for residential use. On the other hand, lead-acid batteries are more cost-effective but have a shorter lifespan and lower energy density compared to Li-Ion batteries. Both types of batteries play a crucial role in storing excess solar power generated by residential solar panels for later use.</p></p>
