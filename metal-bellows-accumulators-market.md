<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal bellows accumulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Fluid Diverter</li><li>Without Fluid Diverter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal bellows accumulators can be categorized into two main types based on the presence of a fluid diverter. With fluid diverter accumulators are designed to separate gas and fluid chambers, allowing for better performance in high-pressure applications. On the other hand, without fluid diverter accumulators do not have this feature, making them simpler and more cost-effective for lower pressure systems. Both types offer unique advantages depending on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
