<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compressor Starter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heavy Hammer Starter</li><li>PTC Starter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Compressor starters are key components in refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Heavy hammer starters utilize a spring-loaded hammer mechanism to initiate compressor operation. On the other hand, PTC starters use a positive temperature coefficient ceramic disc that heats up and increases resistance to help start the compressor. Both types of starters serve the same purpose of initiating and controlling the operation of compressors, but they use different mechanisms to achieve this goal.</p></p>
