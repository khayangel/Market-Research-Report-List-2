<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Overhead Conveyor System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Automatic</li><li>Fully-Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic overhead conveyor systems can be classified into two main types: Semi-Automatic and Fully-Automatic. Semi-Automatic systems require some level of human intervention, such as loading and unloading of materials, while the conveyor system takes care of the transportation process. On the other hand, Fully-Automatic systems operate without any human intervention, from loading to unloading. Both types offer efficiency, speed, and precision in material handling processes, but Fully-Automatic systems are generally considered more advanced and require less human involvement.</p></p>
