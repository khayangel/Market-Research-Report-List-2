<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embolization Coil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pushable Embolization Coil</li><li>Detachable Embolization Coil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Embolization coils are devices used to treat aneurysms or block blood flow in blood vessels. There are two main types of embolization coils: pushable coils and detachable coils. Pushable coils are inserted into the blood vessel and remain in place to block blood flow. Detachable coils are designed to be detached from a delivery wire once they are correctly positioned in the blood vessel. Both types of coils are effective in treating various vascular conditions and have different advantages based on the specific needs of the patient.</p></p>
