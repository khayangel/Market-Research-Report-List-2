<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capacitive Absolute Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Turn</li><li>Multi-turn</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Capacitive absolute encoders come in two main types: single-turn and multi-turn. Single-turn encoders provide position feedback for a single rotation of the shaft, while multi-turn encoders offer feedback for multiple revolutions. Single-turn encoders are suitable for applications that require position feedback within one full rotation, while multi-turn encoders are used for applications that require feedback for multiple revolutions of the shaft. Both types of encoders use capacitive technology to ensure accurate and reliable position feedback.</p></p>
